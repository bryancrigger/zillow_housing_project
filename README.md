[Project In Process]

#### Motivation of Project:
This project is one that I was interested in doing on my own. I have been interested in investing in real estate and was wanting an easier way to reduce the number of houses that I would need to consider as investment possibilities. To do this I wanted to use Zillow housing data to pull in several factors of the house and house's area and have a predictive model estimate what the value of the house should be. With the estimated house value and the current value listed on the house, I would be able to see what houses are the most under valued and use those houses as considerations for investments.

<br/>

#### Questions that I want to Answer:
- What factors play the most into what the value of a house should be? (variable reduction)
- What houses are most under valued next to houses that are the most overvalued? 
- What houses are on the market that are under the estimated value?
- What houses are not on the market, but are also under the estimated value?
